// The purpose of the feature branch is to isolate own changes from a shared workspace, allowing to merge those changes later.
// A new Git repository is set up with the 'git init' command.
// The main branch is the main hub where all changes are met.
// Using the 'git branch' command.
// Using the 'git checkout' command.
// By commiting changes in preparation for a pull request.
// When in main branch: 'git merge feature'.
// Attend to the merge conflicts indicators so the conflicted lines can be addressed.
// To prevent any previous or current changes were not affected.
// Account the safest way to prevent and resolve merge conflicts; also ensure appropriate branch naming.
// Using the command 'git branch -d feature'.
// Ensure other members of the team can comment on the submitted changes and approve them before merging.
// Using the command 'git push feature remote <name-of-repo>'.
// Using the model 'feature/name-of-branch'.
// By pull-rebasing frequently from main.
